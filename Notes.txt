Change Notes:
December 2022:
Updated libsndfile from 1.0.25 to 1.0.28.

Controls Needed:

2. Convert wxwxWavePanel found in SampleSplitter into a wxControl item.
   The problem is that WaveFile is a member, and it depends upon libsndfile.
3. Create wxFloatSlider, a wxSlider that allows float values.
4. Create wxFader, a logarithmic wxBitmapSlider.
6. Fix the drawing routines on wxBitmapSlider.
